    students!</p>
   
    <h2>Why this Program?</h2>
    <p>The Doctorate of Science in <a href="https://math.gatech.edu/graduate/phd-computational-sciences-and-engineering">Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Program</a> is an interdisciplinary
     program offered by the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, and the College of Sciences. The
    CSE program addresses the body of knowledge, skills, and practices associated with the study of computer-based
    models of natural phenomena and engineered systems. Students will be required to obtain a breadth of knowledge
    across a set of core areas in the CSE discipline, depth of knowledge in a specific computational specialization
    (e.g., numerical computing), and knowledge to apply computational techniques in a domain of application. Students
    will be expected to integrate principles from mathematics, computer science, and engineering to be able to create 
    significant computational artifacts (e.g., software).
